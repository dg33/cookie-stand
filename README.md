For the animation I decided to change the color of my header to that of the page but when you hover over the header the background color of the header turns blue. I thought I needed to use the divs for that but apparently I didnt I just applied the :hover manuver after the header element in my css. One thing is did learn about was to stay away from the float mechanism as much as possible I didn't realize that if you float images that it will attempt to fill content on the vacant side. So that is why I used it across from my fancyfish img because I had content to fill the empty side and that that was the exact side I wanted the content. 
For my last img and text I did not use the float method but instead used margin so that I can but the content where I want.
